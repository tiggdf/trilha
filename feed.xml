So, for those who are reading, thank you!</p>

<p>All of the work that I have been doing over the years has been extremely fun, eye opening, and a great experience altogether!</p>

<hr />

<p>A little bit about me. I love watching TV; I like Football and Basketball; I love the UFC MMA. Hopefully, that doesn’t scare you. :smirk:</p>

<h4 id="a-small-bucket-list-will-grow-in-the-future">A Small Bucket List (Will grow in the future)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Attend a UFC match.</li>
    <li>Visit the 7 modern and ancient wonders of the world.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, has anyone actually worn a hoodie and feel warm? Not me.</p>

<hr />

<p>Did I mention I love quotes related to life? Here’s one that sticks with me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If you love it, you’ll teach yourself. If you don’t love it, others will teach you”</p>

  <p>—Yukitaka Yamaguchi</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<p>Best,</p>
